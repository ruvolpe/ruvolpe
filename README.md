&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there! I'm Rubi, a non-binary Brazilian who is a double major (Business and Social Communication) and has a post-graduation course (Storytelling).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is my GitHub, so you're interested in my programming history. It all started when I was thirteen, and after taking a course on hardware support, I decided to study some more and take a course on Web Design. There, I've had my first contact with HTML and CSS. That was back in 2006. Quite a while later, I decided to study coding. I started with programming logic, and soon after finishing the course, I decided to study Web Development. And I ended up enjoying it. Nowadays, I have completed a Front End formation course at Alura and a FullStack boot camp at Kenzie Academy.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TL;DR:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm making a career transition and am very much interested in Junior Web Dev openings!<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're interested in having me on your team, just hit me up at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ru-volpe/">LinkedIn</a>
