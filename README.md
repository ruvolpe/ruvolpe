&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there! I'm Rubi, a non-binary Brazilian who is a double major (Business and Social Communication) and has a post-graduation course (Storytelling).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is my GitHub, so I think you're interested in my programming history. It all started when I was thirteen and, after taking a course on hardware support, I decided to study some more and take a course on Web Design. There, I've had my first contact with HTML and CSS. That was back at 2006. And, quite a while later, I decided to study coding a little bit. I started with programming logic, and soon after finishing the course, I decided to study Web Development. And I ended up enjoying it. Nowadays I have completed a Front End formation course at Alura and am currently studying at Kenzie Academy to become a FullStack Web Developer.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TL;DR:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm making a career transition and am very much interested on Junior Dev openings!<br><br>
