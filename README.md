# Hey there! I'm Rubi

I am a non-binary Brazilian with a double major in Business and Social Communication and a post-graduation course in Storytelling.

## But this is my GitHub, so if you're interested in my programming journey...

It all started when I was thirteen. After taking a course on hardware support, I decided to delve deeper and enrolled in a Web Design course. 

There, I had my first encounter with HTML and CSS in 2006. 

Years later, I developed an interest in coding, so I began with programming logic and ventured into Web Development, which I found immensely satisfying. 

I've completed a Front End formation course at Alura, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then a FullStack boot camp at Kenzie Academy, where I developed projects in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, NodeJs, Express, Postgres, Python and Django.

### TL;DR:

I'm making a career transition and am very interested in Junior Web Dev opportunities! If you're interested in having me on your team, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ru-volpe/).
