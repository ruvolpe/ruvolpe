&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there! I'm Rubi, a non-binary Brazilian who has way too many interests.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two majors (Business and Social Communication) and one post-graduation course (Storytelling). I have worked as an English teacher, as a translator, and as a screenwriter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is my GitHub, so I think you're interested in my programming history. It all started when I was thirteen and, after taking a course on hardware support, I decided to study some more and take a course on Web Design. There, I've had my first contact with HTML and CSS. That was back at 2006. And, quite a while later, I decided to study coding a little bit. I started with programming logic, and soon after finishing the course, I decided to study Web Development. And I ended up enjoying it. Nowadays I'm studyin frontend, backend and some android as well, because it is fun!<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TL;DR:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm just a study enthusiast who's having fun with some languages. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Kotlin, Ruby and C are only the beginning.<br><br>
