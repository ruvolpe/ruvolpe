# Hey there! I'm Rubi
A non-binary Brazilian who is a double major (Business and Social Communication) and has a post-graduation course (Storytelling).<br>
## But this is my GitHub, so you're interested in my programming history. 
It all started when I was thirteen, and after taking a course on hardware support, I decided to study some more and take a course on Web Design. There, I've had my first contact with HTML and CSS. That was back in 2006. Quite a while later, I decided to study coding. I started with programming logic, and soon after finishing the course, I decided to study Web Development. And I ended up enjoying it. Nowadays, I have completed a Front End formation course at Alura and a FullStack boot camp at Kenzie Academy.
### TL;DR:
I'm making a career transition and am very much interested in Junior Web Dev openings!
